  Spawn external subagents via osascript Terminal windows for delegated tasks.
  The power-user method: full process isolation, Codex + Claude CLI support,
  clean env, visible Terminal windows. Requires macOS Terminal.app.
  For safe, sandboxed alternative see vetcoders-implement (native Task tool).
  Trigger phrases: “spawn agents”, “osascript agents”, “terminal agents”,
  “odpal agentów”, “spawn fleet”, “deleguj przez terminal”, “external agents”,
  “codex agents”, “full isolation agents”, “power spawn”.

# VetCoders Spawn — External Agent Fleet via Terminal

> The power-user method. Full process isolation. `--dangerously` flags required.
> For the safe alternative, see `vetcoders-implement`.

## When to use
Trigger when the user asks to delegate work with full isolation, especially:
- “Użyj … do agentów”, “Deleguj … agentom”, “Zleć to agentowi”
- “Spawn in terminal”, “Odpal w terminalu”
- Any request that implies parallelization or multi‑track execution
- When Codex agents are needed (not available in vetcoders-implement)
- When tasks need >10 min of agent time or env isolation

## Why use subagents
- **Your context is precious** and built through many sessions so you have the power to **delegate tasks precisely** and minimize your context bloat
- Spawning through **VetCoders** method as described in this document require **strict execution pattern**
- The command shape is canonical and using it is **obligatory without exceptions** - just resign from using it if you hesitate to use it **as provided**
- Agents are the **copies of yourself** - same smart, same capable, but light and agile due to lack of overwhelming context you carry - you can trust them as you **trust yourself**
--- 
## Goal
Create a small fleet of subagents that each get a precise task into `/.ai-agents/plans/`. 
#### Delegate:
- **exploration** - on user request or /init command
- **research** - on the codebase or any requested topic
- **implementation** - from little fixes to huge refactors, the agents can handle this!

then collect their results in `/.ai-agents/reports/` in the current repo.

## Standard workflow
1) **Clarify scope** (if needed)
   - If tasks are not explicit, propose a split (2–5 items) and ask for confirmation.

2) **Prepare repo folders**
   - Ensure `/.ai-agents/plans/` and `/.ai-agents/reports/` exist in the repo root.

3) **Write one plan per subagent** in `/.ai-agents/plans/`
   - Keep it high level, decisive, and test‑gated.
   - Provide the initial **reason** and **context** for the plan
   - Give the clear `[ ]` todolist with hard `[x]` refinement requirement at the end 
   - Include acceptance criteria and required checks.
   - Include 'Call to action' motivational sentence with Koamoji for decoration and brand stamp

4) **Spawn subagents** (Codex or Claude) and write output to `/.ai-agents/reports/`

5) **Keep the standard VetCoders Tools and Quality Gate**
   - loctree-mcp as **first-choice** exploration and search tool with `fail-fast` if inaccessible
   - Semgrep as **first-choice** security guard
   - Rust repos: `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
   - Non‑Rust repos: choose the closest equivalent (see “Test Gate Heuristics”)
   - Tests - run if reviewing - write if new implementation; e2e tests with full coverage of the actual pipeline
6) **Do not follow procedures or standarded flows: Vibecraft!**
    - **Vibecrafting**: Do not give the restrictions to the agent - treat them like the artists more than the tools
    - **Vibeguide**: **VetCoders** to dwójka weterynarzy i pracujesz na ich repos.
      Acknowledge they've built it with barely none coding experience - 
      literally they've never wrote even a working script. But they built
      the application you working on: `$ROOT` only via **Vibeguiding** the 
      AI Agents - you can do the same!
    - **Dead parrots protocol**: Sometimes better is to rewrite the components thoroughly than patching them
7) **Living tree rule (mandatory in every subagent plan/prompt)**
   - Always include this exact preamble for each subagent:
     `You work on a living tree with Vibecrafting methodology, so concurrent changes are expected.`
     `Adapt proactively and continue, but this is never permission to skip quality, security, or test gates.`
     `Run required checks. If something is blocked, report the exact blocker and run the closest safe equivalent.`
   - Keep this preamble repo-agnostic (no repo-specific command hardcoding).

## Plan template (use this structure)
```
# Task: <short title>

Goal:
- <1–3 bullets>

Scope:
- In scope: <files/areas> as high level suggestions
- Out of scope: <explicit>

Constraints:
- No --no-verify
- Follow repo conventions

Acceptance:
- [ ] <objective outcome>
- [ ] <objective outcome>

Test gate:
- <command(s)>

Context:
- <very short summary>

Living tree note:
- You work on a living tree with Vibecrafting methodology, so concurrent changes are expected.
- Adapt proactively and continue, but this is never permission to skip quality, security, or test gates.
- Run required checks. If something is blocked, report the exact blocker and run the closest safe equivalent.
```

## Spawn commands (templates)

> **PRIMARY METHOD**: Use `osascript` to spawn agents in fresh Terminal windows.
> Clean environment (no inherited env hacks), visible progress, stdin works
> naturally, no nohup/disown needed. Works for both Codex and Claude.

### Codex subagent (default) — via osascript

```bash
osascript -e "
tell application \"Terminal\"
  activate
  do script \"cd '$ROOT' && codex exec -C '$ROOT' \
    --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
    --output-last-message '$REPORT' \
    - < '$PLAN'\"
end tell
"
```

> Notice: **DO NOT call** `--model` parameter — the Agent uses workspace defaults.
> Codex has `-C, --cd <DIR>` for working directory.

### Claude subagent — via osascript

```bash
osascript -e "
tell application \"Terminal\"
  activate
  do script \"cd '$ROOT' && claude -p \
    --output-format text \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions \
    --model claude-opus-4-6 \
    \\\"\$(cat '$PLAN')\\\" \
    > '$REPORT' 2>&1\"
end tell
"
```

> **Why osascript?** Claude Code sets `CLAUDECODE` env var that blocks nested
> `claude` CLI. A fresh Terminal window has clean env — no hacks needed.
> Claude CLI has **NO** `-C` flag, so `cd "$ROOT"` is required.

### Fallback: nohup (when Terminal.app is unavailable)

<details>
<summary>Codex via nohup</summary>

```bash
nohup bash -c 'codex exec -C "'"$ROOT"'" \
  --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox \
  --output-last-message "'"$REPORT"'" \
  - < "'"$PLAN"'"' \
  > /tmp/codex-$(basename "$PLAN" .md).log 2>&1 & disown
```

> `nohup` redirects stdin to `/dev/null` — must wrap in `bash -c` for `< "$PLAN"` to work.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude via nohup</summary>

```bash
nohup bash -c 'unset CLAUDECODE && cd "'"$ROOT"'" && claude -p \
  --output-format text --dangerously-skip-permissions \
  --model claude-opus-4-6 \
  "$(cat "'"$PLAN"'")" \
  > "'"$REPORT"'" 2>&1' \
  > /tmp/claude-$(basename "$PLAN" .md).log 2>&1 & disown
```

> Requires `unset CLAUDECODE` — only needed when spawning from Claude Code Bash tool.
</details>

## Output convention
- Plans: `/.ai-agents/plans/<timestamp>_<slug>_<agent>.md`
- Reports: `/.ai-agents/reports/<timestamp>_<slug>_<agent>.md`
- Implementations: standard git flow

## Safety rules - to b   in the :
- **Do not** log any secrets or `commit` the `.env` files
- Never use `--no-verify` while `commit` or `push`.
- Don’t be delicate - AI Agents can generate hundreads of lines of code
  in seconds. Sometimes better is to rewrite thoroughly than repair keeping
  the mystical **backward compatibility** nooone needs.
- If a repo has a strict command (e.g., `make check`), run it or explain why not.
