//! AI Contexters — the operator front door for agent session logs.
//!
//! `aicx` orchestrates a two-layer pipeline: canonical corpus first,
//! optional semantic index second. Materialization is always explicit.
//!
//! Two-layer architecture:
//!   1. **Canonical corpus** (`~/.aicx/`) — deduplicated, chunked, steerable markdown.
//!      Built by extractors (`claude`, `codex`, `all`) and `store`. This is ground truth.
//!   2. **Optional semantic index** (memex) — vector + BM25 index for semantic
//!      retrieval by agents and MCP tools. Built by `memex-sync` or `--memex` on extractors.
//!      `aicx` owns the canonical corpus; memex is layered on top.
//!
//! Supported sources:
//! - Claude Code: ~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl
//! - Codex: ~/.codex/history.jsonl
