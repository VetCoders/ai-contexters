## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **MCP server** (`aicx serve` / standalone `aicx-mcp` binary): 4 tools (search, rank, refs, store) over stdio and streamable HTTP transports.
- **Per-chunk quality scoring** (`rank.rs`): content-level signal/noise classification (0-10 scale) replacing the old all-SIGNAL output.
- `aicx rank` subcommand with `--strict` (hide noise) and `--top N` flags.
- **Dashboard search API**: `/api/search/fuzzy`, `/api/search/semantic`, `/api/search/cross` endpoints with rmcp-memex integration.
- `/api/health` and `/health` endpoints.
- Polish diacritics normalization for fuzzy search (wdrozenie matches wdrozenie).
- `project=` filter on fuzzy search (scopes to single project).
- Auto-rescan before search queries (incremental, milliseconds).
- Unified JSON error contract for all 400 responses.
- `aicx intents` subcommand for structured intent/decision extraction.
